# Collaborative Experience-Sharing Platform: Implementation Reference

## Overview
This document outlines the technical implementation details for transforming our current social media application into a collaborative experience-sharing platform. The platform will intelligently aggregate individual user perspectives into cohesive, shared moments, creating multi-dimensional views of events like conferences, concerts, and weddings.

## 1. Data Structure Enhancements

### Event/Moment Model
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  location: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    venue?: string;
    address?: string;
  };
  timeRange: {
    start: string; // ISO timestamp
    end: string;   // ISO timestamp
  };
  tags: string[];
  participants: string[]; // User IDs
  posts: string[];        // Post IDs
  visibility: 'public' | 'private' | 'participants';
  createdBy: string;      // User ID
  createdAt: string;      // ISO timestamp
}
```

### Enhanced Post Model
```typescript
interface EnhancedPost {
  // Existing fields
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  userName: string;
  userPhotoURL: string;
  text: string;
  imageURL?: string;
  likes: string[];
  comments: Comment[];
  createdAt: string;
  
  // New fields
  location?: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    accuracy: number;
    altitude?: number;
  };
  deviceOrientation?: {
    alpha: number; // z-axis rotation
    beta: number;  // x-axis rotation
    gamma: number; // y-axis rotation
  };
  eventId?: string;
  contextualTags: string[];
  captureTimestamp: string; // Precise timestamp when content was captured
  mediaMetadata?: {
    width?: number;
    height?: number;
    duration?: number; // For videos
    format?: string;
  };
}
```

## 2. Context Awareness Systems

### Location-Based Clustering
- Implement geospatial indexing using technologies like PostGIS or MongoDB's geospatial queries
- Group posts within configurable radius (e.g., 100m for indoor events, 500m for outdoor festivals)
- Apply time-window constraints (posts within same 4-hour window)
- Algorithm pseudocode:
  ```
  function clusterByLocation(posts, maxDistance, timeWindow):
    clusters = []
    for each post in posts:
      assigned = false
      for each cluster in clusters:
        if distance(post.location, cluster.centroid) < maxDistance AND
           timeDifference(post.timestamp, cluster.timeRange) < timeWindow:
          add post to cluster
          update cluster.centroid
          assigned = true
          break
      if not assigned:
        create new cluster with post
    return clusters
  ```

### Event Recognition
- Implement density-based clustering (DBSCAN) to identify event hotspots
- Use temporal patterns to detect event boundaries
- Consider audio fingerprinting for precise event matching:
  - Sample 10-second audio clips every minute
  - Generate acoustic fingerprints using algorithms like Shazam's
  - Match fingerprints across users to confirm same-event presence

### Semantic Analysis
- Extract entities and topics from post text using NLP
- Implement topic modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
- Create word embeddings for semantic similarity matching
- Use named entity recognition to identify event names, performers, speakers

### Image Analysis
- Implement scene recognition to categorize environments
- Use object detection to identify common elements across posts
- Apply face clustering (with privacy controls) to group photos of same individuals
- Extract visual features for similarity matching using CNN-based embeddings

## 3. User Experience Enhancements

### Event Discovery Interface
- Map view showing nearby active events
- Timeline view of upcoming and recent events
- Personalized recommendations based on interests and social connections
- Search functionality with filters for event type, date range, and location

### Contribution Flow
- Contextual prompts when app detects user is at a recognized event
- Quick-add options to existing events from post creation screen
- Post-capture suggestions to add content to relevant events
- Batch contribution for multiple media items

### Collaborative Timeline
- Chronological view with multiple swim lanes representing different users
- Density indicators showing moments with high activity
- Interactive scrubbing with preview thumbnails
- Filtering options by user, media type, or specific sub-events

### Spatial View
- 3D map representation of venue with post indicators
- Heat map showing coverage density
- AR view option for on-site exploration of content
- Path visualization showing movement patterns through an event

### Perspective Switching
- Swipe gestures to move between perspectives of same moment
- Picture-in-picture view showing alternative angles
- "Around you" circular navigation for 360Â° exploration
- Time-synced playback across multiple video perspectives

## 4. Technical Implementation

- Notifications
```

### Edge Computing Strategy
- Implement progressive web app capabilities for offline support

    // Create spatial grid of venue
    grid = createSpatialGrid(event.location, resolution)
    
    // Mark covered areas
    for each post in event.posts:
      markVisibleArea(grid, post.location, post.deviceOrientation)
    
    // Identify gaps
    gaps = findUnmarkedAreas(grid)
    
    // Prioritize by importance
    rankedGaps = rankByProximityToKeyAreas(gaps, event)
    
    return rankedGaps
  ```
